title: Sentry Plugins and NetServer

NetServer has its own Sentry plugin API, documented in the NetServerÂ Data CHM file.

In order for SOCRM 7 to work, both NetServer and COM plugins must be present and loaded.

NetServer plugins are loaded by adding the DLLs to the &lt;DynamicLoad&gt; section of SUPEROFFICE.CONFIG.
