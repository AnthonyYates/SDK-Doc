Adding an appointment to SuperOffice without displaying the appointment dialog
==============================================================================

Here we log in to the database directly, so the SOCRM application does not need to be running for this to work.

If the login fails, then isOk will be false and an error message is displayed.

We use the <see cref="SuperOffice.COM.SuperOfficeDB.IFind">Find</see> object to find the id for the contact named "SuperOffice ASA".

We create an appointment and then call the <see cref="IAppointment.SetDefaults">SetDefaults</see> method to make sure it has some sensible values in it before we start tweaking its settings.

The Contact and Task type of the new appointment are set, as is the text of the appointment. Note that the Contact and Task properties take objects instead of ids.

Finally we save the appointment to the database. You should be able to find the appointment in the diary or under the SuperOffice company.

```vb
set soDb = CreateObject("SuperOfficeDB.Database")
isOk = soDb.Login("user", "pass")
if isOk Then
   enTableTask = 67                      ' constant that VBScript doesn't know about
   contactId = soDB.Find.FirstMatch("contact", "contact\_id", "name", "SuperOffice ASA")
   set theContact = soDb.GetContact( contactId )
   set newAppoint = soDb.CreateAppointment
   newAppoint.SetDefaults
   newAppoint.Contact = theContact
   newAppoint.Template = soDb.GetListItemByName( enTableTask, "Lunch" )
   newAppoint.Description = "This is a meeting generated by the Client SDK"
   newAppoint.Save
   MsgBox "Appointment created"
else
   MsgBox "Login failed"
end if
```
