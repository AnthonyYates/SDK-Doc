Mail plugins are complex, because they live partly in SOCRM, and partly inside the mail client.

 

[Sender plugins](guideMailSender.md) are simplest, since they hand content from SuperOffice to the mail client for sending.

[Reader plugins](guideMailPluginReader.md) are more complex, since they scan the inbox and read message contents.

 

Mail Archive plugins are not part of SuperOffice, but are plugins into Outlook, Notes or other mail clients that help you archive messages.

The [MailArchiveHelper library](guideMailArchivePlugin.md) helps you interact with SuperOffice as an e-mail oriented document archive.
