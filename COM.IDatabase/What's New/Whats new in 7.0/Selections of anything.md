Working with collections of data
Making selection of anything for everyone
Using a selection as:

-   an document archive
-   a calling list
-   a to-do list
-   a folder or container

So easy that you can focus on your segmentation skills and leave the tech stuff to a professional tool.

Selection of different entities: Contact+Person, Project, Sales, Appointments, Documents

Shadow selections are the companies referenced in the main selection.
i.e. if you have a selection of 3 appointments: 2 with company A and 1 with company B, then the shadow selection contains just company A + B.

3 types of selections:

-   Static - manually managed contents.
-   Dynamic - search results
-   Combined - set arithmetic using two other selections.

Combined selections can combine two of the same type. 
e.g. sale selection + sale selection 2 = sale selection combined selection.

They can also combine different types, yielding a contact+person selection as the result. This is done by operating on the shadow selections of the two source selections.
e.g. sale selection + document selection = company+person combined selection.

Tasks on selections can be user-defined using the ExtApp MDO list in SOADMIN.

You can define custom tasks for certain types of selections.
