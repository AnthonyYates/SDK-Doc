##VALUE

SODocument - object containing the document that is linked to this appointment.


##EXAMPLE

**Show documentlink**

This text may be copied to the notepad, and saved as a *.vbs file. You need a running CRM 5 to make it work. (This example uses the SuperOffice COM application library and not the SuperOffice db library interface). 

This returns the filename of a linked document, if there is any.
