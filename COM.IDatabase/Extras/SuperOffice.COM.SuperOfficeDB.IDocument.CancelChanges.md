##SUMMARY

If you made changes to the model that you donâ€™t want to be saved to the database, call the CancelChanges method


##EXAMPLE

**CancelChanges**

This text may be copied to the notepad, and saved as a *.vbs file. Remember to change the login information.



This will change the description text of the document. If you dont want to save the changes, NO calls the CancelChanges method. If you want to save the changes, YES calls the ChangeIdentity() that saves the document model to the database.
