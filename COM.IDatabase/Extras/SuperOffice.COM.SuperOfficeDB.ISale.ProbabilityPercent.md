##SUMMARY

There is a predefined list of probabilities, but the user may change the probability percent. For example, if the customer has said he wants the product but has still not signed the contract, the normal probability could be set to 90 %. But, if the sales person knows that this customer is very reliable, he could change the probability to 100 %. ProbabilityPercent will then return 100.


##VALUE

Long â€“ the value of the probability set by the user.
