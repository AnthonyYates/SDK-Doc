We start off by creating a new web application project in Visual Studio.

First, add the references to the CRM.web framework. We will need references to:

* SuperOffice.Core.dll
* SuperOffice.CRMWeb.dll
* SuperOffice.DCF.dll
* SuperOffice.DCFWeb.dll
* SuperOffice.Services.dll

Add a new web user control to your project, and name the control SaleForeignKeys.ascx.
