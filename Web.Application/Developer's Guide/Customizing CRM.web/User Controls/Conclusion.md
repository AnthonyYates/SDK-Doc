In this article we have taken a look at how to create a user control that inherits from CRM web and thereby taps into the context of the CRM.web application directly, giving you access to everything that the standard SuperOffice user control has access to. We saw how to set up the user control in a new view in an existing page, and how you can easily configure your user control by using the configuration section for the control in the page configuration file.
