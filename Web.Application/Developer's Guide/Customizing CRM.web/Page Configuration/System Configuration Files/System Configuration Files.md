## Overview

System file **SoApplicationConfiguration.config**, contains all of the page and dialog declarations, essentially cataloging all of the files that represent UI components. System file **SoObjectMapping.config** maps all element types used in page configurations to actual user and web controls defined in assemblies. Both of these system files contain more than what's described here, but this explanation is useful in that it describes how the contents of system files are different that dedicated page configuration files.

Other files considered to be system files include:

- SoAdminApplicationConfiguration.config
- SoFilterList.config
- SoObjectMapping.config
- SoArchiveColumnList.config
- SoArchiveControlLinkInfoTypes.config
- SoArchiveCriteriaList.config
- SoMenuConfiguration.config
