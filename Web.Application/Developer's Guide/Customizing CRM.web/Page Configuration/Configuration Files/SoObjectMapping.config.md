This file defines all controls and assemblies known to CRM.web. If you want to have your own assemblies be known by CRM.web, you need to add &lt;object /&gt; elements here.



 

There are several different object types, like Control, UserControl, AjaxMethod, etc. We will be using some of these in later examples.
