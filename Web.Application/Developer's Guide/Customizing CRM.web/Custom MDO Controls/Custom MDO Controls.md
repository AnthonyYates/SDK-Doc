MDO stands for Multi-Departmental Organization, which is an old term Superoffice-wise. They wanted to have a listing tool that could be used for many different things across organizations. So MDOs are lists populated with data from various tables, and are used frequently throughout both the web and windows clients of SIX.

These controls have search capabilites built-in, and will by default contain the last records you visited for the entity in question, e.g. Contacts, Persons, Projects, etc.

You can create your own MDOs containing anything, whether that would be static data, data from another system, or specific data from Superoffice.
