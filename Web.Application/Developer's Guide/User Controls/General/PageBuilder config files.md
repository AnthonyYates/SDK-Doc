The PageBuilder is the mechanism that is defined by SuperOffice to build the pages of the CRM.web application. The PageBuilder framework consists of different config files including

* Page config files
* Panel config files
* Card config files
* View config files
* Object mapping files
* Application config files

The PageBuklder uses the above config files together with the current values from the SuperState to build the web-pages that the user sees.
