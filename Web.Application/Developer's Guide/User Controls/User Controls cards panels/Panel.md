Panel
=====

The panel object is the top level UI frame for the interface. The panel can contain any number of cards, which are canvases on which we can place views using different layout rules.

Note that it is up to the panel implementation to interpret what these cards are going to be used for, and how they are shown.

The cards can contain any number of views which are laid out according to the definition on the card and the properties of the control.
