There are two types of list in the Six Web application

* SoListBox
* MDOList

The SoListBox is a drop down control that will display a flat list which will not support categorized list and it will not support searching as well. The MDO (Multi-Departmental Orientation) list is the control that will support sub-list and search functionality. It will support categorized lists as well as searching. The config file settings for both the controls are similar so in this document we will focus on the MDO list control since this is the most widely used list control in the Six Web application.
