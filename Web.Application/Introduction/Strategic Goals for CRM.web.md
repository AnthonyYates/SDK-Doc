# Strategic Goals

The development of SuperOffice CRM web has the following strategic goals:

## Functional parity with SuperOffice CRM for Windows

Being able to offer two app
lications working alike is a huge advantage. It leaves customers with a simple choice and provides user simplicity – especially if both clients are being used.

### Rich, fast and flexible User Interface

New technology is closing the gap between windows and web-based applications. For years SuperOffice has been in the forefront of creating rich and usable windows applications. With CRM web they are doing the same on the web.

### Multiple browser support

SuperOffice used to be tied to Internet Explorer only, but no more. SuperOffice CRM web is comfortably running in Chrome, FireFox, Opera and Safari as well. This means being able to accommodate user preferences regarding browsers. It also implies that CRM web can be used on workstations running Linux or Mac OS. With the unique office application integration technology, this provides freedom of choice on the client side, and provides a unique selling point vs. for example Microsoft CRM.

## Scalable Architecture

SuperOffice is currently attracting larger companies with a larger number of concurrent users. This calls for increased scalability to ensure performance. These kinds of customers also have an infrastructure that often requires deployment over several servers: database-, web- and application-servers. With CRM web the customers are just going to get what they want.

### Built-in Customization Capabilities

Modify, remove, extend and embed through settings and preferences in the admin-client. No programming needed. The functionality and User Interface of CRM web is customizable.

### Programmable Customization Capabilities

Think of SuperOffice as a Rubik’s Cube. It can be twisted, changed in form and colour, but it cannot be taken apart. This is our windows client. Then imagine you are able to split the Cube into separate blocks. You can modify some of the blocks, remove some and totally replace others – and then re-assemble the whole Cube. You can even take a single block and mount it separately into another application or a portal! This is refered to as the [SuperOffice CRM Web Platform](architecture.md).

This is of course a simplified picture, not the whole story, but the point is this: **CRM web is built for customization and suit individual needs.** We will not hide the fact that you have to be a skilled programmer to do this, but in the future we will exploit this capability to open new business opportunities

Note that the "Standard edition" of CRM web comes with an extensive and well documented SDK. SuperOffice's ISV and System Integrator partners will find API’s that goes beyond what is available for SIX for Windows. This is a real motivation for SuperOffice to build competence on Expander in both the partner and user community.
