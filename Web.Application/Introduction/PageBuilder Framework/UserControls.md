UserControls, or GUI controls, are the building blocks of CRM.web web page. Many of the UserControls are simple controls for example SoButton, SoCheckBox, SoInputButton, SoTextBox and many more. There are more complex controls like the ContactMainView or the PersonDialogHeader, which contains multiple simple controls. The controls are identified by the relevant config file and the actual objects will be mapped using the config file called SoObjectMapping.config.
