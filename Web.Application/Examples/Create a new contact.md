Users create new contacts by clicking the NEW button in the GUI.

Programs canâ€™t click buttons for the user. Instead they use SOProtocol to tell CRM.web to act as if the NEW button was clicked.

The SO Protocol for activating EDIT  is like this:

```
      contact.main[mode=edit]
```

 

The SO Protocol for activating NEW is like this:

```
      contact.main[mode=edit&new=true]
```

 

NEW mode is just editing a blank contact, so this is equivalent to

```
      contact.main[mode=edit]?contact_id=0
```

 

There are two direct ways to open a new contact by using the URLs containing SOProtocol shown below.

```
http://localhost/SuperOfficeWeb/default.aspx?contact.main[mode=edit&new=true]?contact_id=0
```

or

```
http://localhost/SuperOfficeWeb/default.aspx?contact.main[mode=edit&new=true]
```

 

User needs to fill required data fields such as company name, department, street address, postal address, country, before clicking the OK  button to save the data to the database.
