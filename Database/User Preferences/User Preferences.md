These pages describe the user-preferences used in the SIX.win and SIX.web application.

Note that many of these preferences control important system functions, and changing the values or adding a new preference value may cause the SuperOffice application or specific functionality (like travel or area management) to stop working.

In other words, be very careful when manipulating these preferences.
