Expander SDK: Database Documentation
====================================

This is the documentation for the SuperOffice 8.1 database.

This manual describes the internal SuperOffice database. In particular, it explains the naming-conventions that are in use and how the individual database tables are related to each other.

The manual is written for the programming user. This manual is not for the typical business user of SuperOffice. That is to say, it has been assumed that you have a basic, working knowledge of using databases. By reading the manual it should be possible to gain a good understanding of the product's database structure.

In particular, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with terms such as table (or file), column (or field), row (or record), relation, checksum and database dictionary. It is also important to have knowledge of basic SQL - the Structured Query Language. By using the information in this manual the reader will be able to access, to edit and to insert new records into the SuperOffice database.

The examples show how to insert, how to update and how to manipulate data in a SuperOffice database. These include examples of SQL-code for Sybase Anywhere and Oracle database systems.

 

If you have never programmed against the SuperOffice database before, check out the [Getting Started](Getting Started/Getting Started.md) section.

If you want to know what is new in the 8.1 database, check out [what's new](Whats New/Whats New.md).

If you want to know how to work with dynamic selections or SAINT counters, check out the [Developer Guide](Developer Guide/Developer Guide.md).

If you need a cook-book to copy recipes out of, take a look in the [Programming Examples](Programming%20Examples/Programming%20Examples.md).

The [info documents](Reference/Reference.md) under database reference describe the magical values that go into certain tables.
