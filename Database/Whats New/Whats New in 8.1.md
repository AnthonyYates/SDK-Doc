New design is one of major changes for SuperOffice 8.1

In SuperOffice 8.0 the dictionary has been changed. The new [CDD (Continuous Database Development)](ContinuousDatabase.md) dictionary allows partners and SuperOffice to add and modify tables without rebuilding the entire product.

 

In SuperOffice 8 we have introduced a new user plan. That will give our user an easier understanding of what the user plan is used for and a better use of the licenses. The new user plans are:
• Standard CRM
• Sales
• Marketing
• Service
• Complete  

There are several changes in the 8.0 database.  Five new tables are added during the upgrade

There is a new table that will support a generic “favourite” (yellow star) functionality across clients.

We have planned new functionallity and there are 4 new tables created for this.

Ticket\_Type, Ticket\_Relation\_Type, Ticket\_Relation\_Action, Ticket\_Relation: These tables support new functionality in Service, where you can define request types, relations between requests of certain types, and actions to be taken.

We have also added new fields on several tables and increased field length on others.
