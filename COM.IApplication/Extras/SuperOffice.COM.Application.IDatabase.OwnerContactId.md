##SUMMARY


The owner contact is the most important contact in the database, if this contact is deleted or changed without a new key code from SuperOffice the database is destroyed so it will return an error if you try to change e.g the name of the contact object with contact_id = ownercontactid.



##EXAMPLE

**Display the owners contactID**

This text may be copied to the notepad, and saved as a *.vbs file. Remember to change the login information.
