##EXAMPLE

**CanEditUserLevel**

This text may be copied to the notepad, and saved as a *.vbs file. You need a running CRM 5 to make it work. (This example uses the SuperOffice COM application library and not the SuperOffice db library interface). 



This will return the user with username HUGO from the SOAdmin.Username example.
