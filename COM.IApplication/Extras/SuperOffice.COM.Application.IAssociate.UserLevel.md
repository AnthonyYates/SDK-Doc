##SUMMARY


Obsolete - from SIX we use %roles:SOCOMApplicationLib~IAssociate~Role%. The associates userlevel, the same as set in the admin client. 

UserLevel: 

    0=admin 

    1=full access 

    2=group 

    3=group-read 

    4=own 

    5=read-only contacts+projects. 



##EXAMPLE

**Get userlevel**

This text may be copied to the notepad, and saved as a *.vbs file. You need a running CRM 5 to make it work. (This example uses the SuperOffice COM application library and not the SuperOffice db library interface).
