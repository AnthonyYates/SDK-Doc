The preferred ListText item will be returned if Index is not given (ListText item with rank=1). 

Use the Count() method to find how many members there are. 



##EXAMPLE

**Get history items for the DocTmpl table**

This text may be copied to the notepad, and saved as a *.vbs file. You need a running CRM win client to make it work. (This example uses the SuperOffice COM application library and not the SuperOffice db library interface).
