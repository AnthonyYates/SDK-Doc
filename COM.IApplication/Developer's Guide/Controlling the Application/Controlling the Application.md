title: Controlling the Application
---

There are several ways of controlling the application.
[SOProtocol](http://techdoc.superoffice.com/?sixSOProtocol.html): No scripting needed. Works with the integrated web browser – web pages can control the CRM client user-interface. Also works with normal Internet Explorer. The web page can't write data into the database, it can just show you things. Only way to display specific web panel: superoffice:stuff.to.show.separated.by.dots

[Using the current system](@guideCurrent) and [SuperOffice application](@guideAppInteracting)

Using a [Scripting Engine in SOCRM.exe](@guideScriptingEngine)

Using the [events](@guideEvents)
