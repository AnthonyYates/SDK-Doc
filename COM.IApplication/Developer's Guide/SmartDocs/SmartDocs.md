SuperOffice CRM 5 with Smart Documents enables improved workflow processes related to sales and marketing functions, such as generating proposals, opportunity management, and follow-up activities. This solution leverages the Research Task Pane and Smart Tags built into Microsoft Office Word 2003, allowing the user to access a number of small SuperOffice CRM applications while working within a Word 2003 document.
As an example, when a proposal template is used, the user can access the CRM 5 database directly from the Task Pane.
Additionally, the user can generate follow-up tasks, create new sales opportunities, and perform other sales activities that can be saved directly to the SuperOffice CRM database from the Task Pane or a Word 2003 document. All activities can be customized to corporate workflow definitions.
