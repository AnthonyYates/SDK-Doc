Get a List of People
====================

 

In this section, we will look at few of the ways in which a list of Persons can be retrieved i.e. with the use of the ContactAgent and PersonAgent.  We could also have used the Person agentâ€™s GetPersonsFromContact since we are just reading some simple properties out of the results. GetPersonsFromContact returns simple read-only carriers.
