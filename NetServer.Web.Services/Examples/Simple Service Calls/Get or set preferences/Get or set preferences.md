Get or set preferences
======================

Preferences are used to “personalize” the SO client, here we store information on default values the user have set, different visual settings and you may even use this table i.e. the userpreference table to store your own preferences for your won application. For example we can set the size of the calendar, starting time of the calendar, end time of an all day event and many more. In NetServer we can either retrieve the current values of these preferences or set our own values to them.

In this section we will explain how to Get and Set preferences using SuperOffice.Services layer.
