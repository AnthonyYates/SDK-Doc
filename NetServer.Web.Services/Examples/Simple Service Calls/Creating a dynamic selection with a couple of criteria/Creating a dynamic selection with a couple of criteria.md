Creating a dynamic selection with a couple of criteria
======================================================

 

A Dynamic Selection is a Selection that is bound to change dynamically and is based on a search criteria. A typical Dynamic Selection would be “Add all contacts with a specific Business type”. This will cause the member count of the selection to increase each time a new Contact is added to the database that match the business type specified as a search criterion for the Selection. It is possible to have many search criteria for a single dynamic selection.
