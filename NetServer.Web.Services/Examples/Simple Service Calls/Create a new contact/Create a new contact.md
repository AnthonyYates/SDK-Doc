Create a new contact
====================

 

Contact Entity represents a business object. It contains a set of properties bundled up as a single unit representing a particular business object. Entities contain properties of different data types such as properties of basic data types like int, string, boolean, entities, entity arrays, EntityElement and LocalizedField.

An important point to remember!

Person property of the ContactEntity is a “read-only” Person item, and not a PersonEntity.
