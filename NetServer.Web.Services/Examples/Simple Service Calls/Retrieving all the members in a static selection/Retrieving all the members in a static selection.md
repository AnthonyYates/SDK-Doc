Retrieving all the members in a static selection
================================================

 

We can select contact and persons through the selection interface in NetServer. Each selection returns members that match the selection criteria. For a static selection these members are stored in the selectionmember table. Each selection is recorded in the selection table. In this section we will discuss how to retrieve members in a selection using the NetServer Services layer.
