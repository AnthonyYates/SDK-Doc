A carrier is a object that will carry the data between the Agent and the NetServer services. There are two kinds of carriers: simple read-only carriers and complex entity carriers.   Complex entity carriers can be updated and sent back for saving to the database, while simple read-only carriers cannot be saved back to the database.
