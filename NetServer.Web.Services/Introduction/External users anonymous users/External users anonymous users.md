We can have two different types of users known as external and anonymous, but we need to obtain a separate license to activate them. These two users have different types of rights. We can the anonymous when we have taken a decision to make all our data public. If we allow the anonymous any one can log into the system and view our data. We can use external users when we have decided to make our data not so public. We can use this user type when we are working with partners or customers. The main objective of this section is explaining the properties and the uses of these two users.
