DCF for Web: Superoffice.DCFWeb.DLL
-----------------------------------

This assembly provides the base definitions for the page builder framework.
Unfortunately it does not provide the page builder framework itself - that is still tied to SIX.web.

The most useful things here are:

* Tooltip helper - formats the general tooltip strings into HTML.
