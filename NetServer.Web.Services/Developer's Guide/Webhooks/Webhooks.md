**Webhooks** are a way to broadcast events that happen inside SuperOffice as they occur. A webhook payload includes information that describes what has changed, and is broadcast to all applications that have subscribed to a corresponding event.

The webhook workflow begins with applications subscribing to events that are interesting. The way an application does this is by adding one or more webhook definitions in SuperOffice.

For example: the Partner Application registers an interest in `contact.created` events with SuperOffice. From then on, whenever a contact record is created, SuperOffice will notify the Partner Application that the event has occurred. The Partner Application can then update its own state, get more information, or just log the information.

Lets start by looking at a webhook definition - what the Partner Application uses to register its interest in events with SuperOffice.
