Note that documentation and the user interface will often talk about **criterion** and **criterias**.

The corresponding concept in NetServer is known as an **archive-restriction.**

Both represent an object consisting of

* A field name
* An operator appropriate to the field (equals, begins with, greater than, etc)
* Zero or more values for the operator to operate on.

Please make a note of it.
