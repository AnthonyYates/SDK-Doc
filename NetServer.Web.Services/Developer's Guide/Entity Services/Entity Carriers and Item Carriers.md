A carrier is an object which carries data between the Agents and the NetServer services. There are two types of carriers: simple read-only carriers commonly know as Item carriers and complex Entity carriers. The main difference between these two carriers is that the Entity carriers can be updated and sent back for saving to the database but it is not possible in item carriers.
