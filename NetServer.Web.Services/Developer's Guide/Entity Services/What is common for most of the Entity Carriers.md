Most of the Entity carriers have a set of common features such as ExtraFields, FieldProperties, TableRight, UserDefinedFields, RegisteredDate, RegisteredBy.

The ExtraFields contain extra fields added to the carrier. This could be data from Plug-ins, foreign key system, external application and etc.

FieldProperties are the specific properties of an Entity that come under different fields of the table representing that Entity. For an example the Person Entity has FieldProperties such as Category, Contact, Business and etc.

The TableRight field is a specific property that used to check the user rights to access data tables.

UserDefinedFields are used to store the user defined values. When we have created a field, we will not be able to change the datatype of this field. We will then have to drop the field and create it once more using the desired datatype.

RegisteredDate- registerd date is given by this property.

RegisteredBy- registered by whom, is given by this property.
