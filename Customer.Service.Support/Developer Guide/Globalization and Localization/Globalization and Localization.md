# SuperOffice Globalization

SuperOffice has great support for globalization by providing a culture-neutral and language-neutral user inteface that supports localized labels and regional data throught the application, as well as exposing an API to augment string resources throughout the platform.

## Globalization

SuperOffice supports localized interfaces and regional data for users in more than fifteen cultures, and is written in such a way that is easily extended to support other cultures or regions not included by default.

## Localization

Localization is the process of translating an application's resources into localized versions for each culture that the application will support.

Working with formatted addresses is an example of localized content. To learn how to get and set company and contact address information, see the [Address Formats](Localization/Address%20Formats.md) page.
