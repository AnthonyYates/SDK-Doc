The debug panel
===============

There is a debug panel in the system which will allow you to set various debugging parameters. These parameters are stored in cookies in your browser, and consequently only apply to your session. This enables you to debug an installation without disturbing all the other users, as well as getting too much information in the logs. (For logging, it is also possible to set a global flag in the registry table, which then will have effect for all users). To access the debug panel, navigate to .../rms.exe?action=debug. There you will find a simple panel of debugging flags which you may enable.
