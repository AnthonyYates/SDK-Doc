**ejScript**: ejScript is our scripting language, which provides access to entities and business objects. Read and write access. Consistency and tries to be backward compatible

**Fields and table designer**: Create new fields on existing entities, or create completly new table/entities. Supports creating references to the most importants entities (including those you create yourself). Results in auto generated screens for displaying, searching and editing data.

**Forms designer**: Create your own screens, using configurable pre defined GUI elements. Tightly connected with ejScript, where you will write the logic of the screen.
