All NetServer services/agents reachable through ejScript

â€“      Except EmailAgent, TrayAppAgent, FileManagerAgent and AudienceAgent

* Easy and fast to get going

* Executes as the logged in user

All NetServer services are reachable through ejScript. You do not need to do any setup as Customer Service is already configured to use a specific NetServer.

You will be authenticated in NetServer with the logged in users. For background tasks as mail import, scheduled tasks and Data Exchange (DBI) you will be logged in as a system user. This means that Sentry will apply to your ejScripts.
