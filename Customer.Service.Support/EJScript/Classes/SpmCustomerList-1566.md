This class is used to create a list of recipients for the eMarketeer module. The list can be used either from the GUI or through ejScript by using the SpmShipment class.
This list consist of customer ids, so all recipients you want to add must be an existing customer in the database.


Note: From version 4.0 you could use a selection of type "ejScript" to accoplish the same as this class do.
