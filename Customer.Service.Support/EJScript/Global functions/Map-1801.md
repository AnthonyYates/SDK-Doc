Map constructor.


This constructor will parse a string of [name] = [value] and insert it into
  a Map, which will be returned. The string may look something like
  this:

    Foo = bar

        helpFile = c:\winnt\help.hlp

    someStirng = This is a test: 2 + 2 = 4

It also supports multiple-line values, indicated by value starting with whitespace.
  E.g.
    Foo = this is a value
     which spans several lines,
     and that can be quite
     convenient.

  The first whitespace of a continuing line is deleted.


* **text:** String with names and values
* **Returns:** Map object containing name-value pairs.
