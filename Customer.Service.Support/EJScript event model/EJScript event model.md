This section describes the event model which has been enabled from version 4.2. The scripts are connected to events by setting the include-id of the script to values recognized by the system. Currently, only event scripts for pages are supported, which are in the namespace "HtmlPage.". In the future, other events, such as database saving or loading may be supported by using other namespace areas.
