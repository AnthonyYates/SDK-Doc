# SuperOffice Globalization

SuperOffice has great support for globalization by providing a culture-neutral and language-neutral user inteface that supports localized labels and regional data throught the application, as well as exposing an API to augment string resources throughout the platform.

SuperOffice supports localized interfaces and regional data for users in more than fifteen cultures, and is written in such a way that is easily extended to support other cultures or regions not included by default.

**[Resource Providers](Resource%20Providers/Resource%20Providers.md)** are used to supply localized resource strings, and provide the means for third-parties to override existing, or supply new, resource strings in SuperOffice. 

To see a list of all available resource strings, see the [Resource Strings](https://community.superoffice.com/documentation/SDK/SO.NetServer.Data.Access/html/T_SuperOffice_Globalization_RC.htm) section.
