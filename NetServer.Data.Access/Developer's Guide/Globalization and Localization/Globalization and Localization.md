# SuperOffice Globalization

SuperOffice has great support for globalization by providing a culture-neutral and language-neutral user inteface that supports localized labels and regional data throught the application, as well as exposing an API to augment string resources throughout the platform.

## Globalization

SuperOffice supports localized interfaces and regional data for users in more than fifteen cultures, and is written in such a way that is easily extended to support other cultures or regions not included by default.

## Localization

Localization is the process of translating an application's resources into localized versions for each culture that the application will support.

Refer to the [Resource Providers](Resource%20Providers\Resource%20Providers.md) documentation to learn more about how to include more culture-specific resources for SuperOffice.
