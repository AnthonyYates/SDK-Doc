The security section group contains three configuration sections related to domain and operational security settings.

</Security>
```

### ActiveDirectoryCredentialPlugin

Configuration settings related to Active Directory domain.

|Name|Description|
|------------|----|
|Domain|Name of the domain for authentication.  Default domain is used when nothing is provided. The name of the domain or server for System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.ContextType.Domain context types, the machine name for System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.ContextType.Machine context types, or the name of the server and port hosting the System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.ContextType.ApplicationDirectory instance.|
|Container|The container on the store to use as the root of the context. Default container is used when nothing is provided. All queries are performed under this root.|
|User|The username used to connect to the store. If the username and password parameters are not configured, the default credentials of the current principal are used. Otherwise, both username and password must be configured, and the credentials they specify are used to connect to the store.|
|Password|The user password used to connect to the store.|
|DisableIntegration|Disable integration with Active Directory. The default value is false.|

### Cryptography

Cryptography is used for encrypting and decrypting the user sessions.

|Name|Description|
|------------|----|
|SymmetricKey|The Key used in the Rijndael algorithm.|
|SymmetricIV|The IV used in the Rijndael algorithm.|
|SymmetricSecret|A secret phrase used as a signature.|

The SymmetricKey and the SymmetricIV are used in the Rijndeal (System.Security.Cryptography.Rijndael) based encrypting and decrypting methods. The SymmetricSecret is used to compute a hash code using the SHA256Managed classes (System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256Managed). The key value pairs in the section are used in NetServer session suspend and session continue routines.

When a seccion is suspended the SymmetricKey and the SymmetricIV are used to encrypt the session information, where the SymmetricSecret creates a hash code. Using a CryptoStream ( System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream ), the encrypted session data and the computed hash will be written to a MemoryStream ( System.IO.MemoryStream ) and returned as a Base64String for subsequent calls to a sessions ```Continue``` method.

In ```SoSession.Continue```, the SymmetricKey and the SymmetricIV will be used to decrypt the session data, and the SymmetricKey will be used to compute the hash code. The hash code generated by ```session.Suspend``` method is checked against the hash code generated by the continue method to verify weather the encrypted and decrypted information are the same and have not been tampered.

The SymmetricKey and the SymmetricIV are generated values while the SymmetricSecret is a user defined secret.

It is important to know that if your system is using a server cluster these values should be identical in all cluster machines.

### Sentry

Sentry configuration options.

|Name|Description|
|------------|----|
|Ignore|Ignore the Sentry mechanism, everything will be allowed. Default value is false.|

### SoPasswordCredentialPlugin

SuperOffice password credentials plugin options.

|Name|Description|
|------------|----|
|DisableUseInternalAssociate|Disables SuperOffice-passwords for Internal associates (normal users). Default value is false.|
|DisableUseSystemAssociate|Disables SuperOffice password for System associates. Default value is false.|
|DisableUseExternalAssociate|Disables SuperOffice password for External associates. Default value is false.|
